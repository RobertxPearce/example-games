IMPORTANT: READ ME!

In order to open Scene.qs in Quorum Studio, you must add extra resources to your Quorum Studio installation. To do this:

1. Open up file browser (e.g. File Explorer on Windows or Finder on Mac)
2. Navigate to the Platformer project
3. Under Resources/Tileset, make a copy of two files, "Switches.json" and "Switches.png"
4. Move the copied files into your Quorum Studio's Resources/Tileset folder. By default on Windows, this will be located at "C:\Program Files\QuorumStudio\Resources\Tilesets"
5. Make sure the copied files have the exact same name as the original files!

Once you've copied the files, you should be ready to work with the scene and run the game.
